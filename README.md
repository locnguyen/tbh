## ToDos

Given more time the following features would be needed for this to be operational

* Hook up the mutation to save a survey response to the onclick handler of the submit button
* Add form validation
* Have a home page to list sessions and survey response
* Clean up the UI to match the Figma
* Make the UI responsive so end users can reply on mobile phones
* Use a real database to persist the data
* Implement real authentication
* Add a CI/CD pipeline with some unit and integration tests
